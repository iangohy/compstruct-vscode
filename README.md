VSCode Extension for Computation Structures Courseware (jsim, tmsim, bsim)

## Installation

You can install this extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jamestiotio.compstruct-vscode) or from the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/jamestiotio/compstruct-vscode)!

## Description

This repository hosts a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) with rich language support for the courseware used in the (labs of) Computation Structures module (both MIT 6.004 and SUTD 50.002): jsim, tmsim and bsim.

These tools were originally developed by MIT:
- JSim is a netlist simulator language which serves as a circuit simulator design environment.
- BSim is a Beta ALU architecture simulator. The Î² is a RISC processor design (general-purpose 32-bit architecture) used for the course.
- TMSim is a Turing Machine simulator.

## Known Issues

This section will call out known issues to help limit users opening duplicate issues against this extension.

### JSim Continuation Lines Detection Issue

Multiline detection which spans across newline characters (and indicated by lines starting with the character `+`) might not be supported yet by the TextMate grammar engine as elaborated [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate/issues/32). To add support for this feature, might need to migrate to Monarch instead of TextMate or implement a more sophisticated, real-time detector using TypeScript.

### Syntax Highlighting for Negative Numbers

More work needs to be done since attempts of using regular expressions to syntax-highlight negative numbers (i.e. including the hyphens) did not work as intended.
